- 👋 Hi, I’m @h-gf-sh

- 👀 I’m interested in the subject-object relationship between data and information, with special emphasis on storage. More specifically, if data is a measurement of the property of an object, then it must be understood in the context of the observer by the means of observation, in which an object becomes a subject measured by and by means of the observer. The observer, on the other hand, measures data in order to assemble a working model of the subject for the sake of understanding the object in its context, in order that an abstraction of the data may lend itself usefully to other contexts than the one in which it were observed. A principal battery of questions emerges: how is this data stored; how is it recalled; how is it interacted with; and what is it that is built? From here, commence. Positing herein that the neuronal equivalent of data is assembled in the cortex in rough equivalency to a nodal p2p network, and that chunked data is modular and identified by property. This ought to lend itself neatly to an interaction between information theory and cognitive linguistics, if only the hagfish could find the time. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning mySQL, Python, Rasbian, the history of empire, Koine Greek, number theory, Cybersecurity via IBM's Cybersecurity Specialist Pre-Apprenticeship track, and whatever you need me to learn to get the job done.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything involving data storage and information modeling, especially if there is an overlap with human linguistics. Bonus points if it involves metaphor theory or abstract linguistic processes.
